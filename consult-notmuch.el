;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides two commands using consult to query notmuch
;; emails and present results either as single emails
;; (`consult-notmuch') or full trees (`consult-notmuch-tree').
;;
;; The package also defines a narrowing source for `consult-buffer',
;; which can be activated with
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'consult-buffer-sources 'consult-notmuch-buffer-source)

;; This elisp file is automatically generated from its literate
;; counterpart at
